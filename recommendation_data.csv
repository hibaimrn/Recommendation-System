Pros:
Customizable, linking between remotes, backup system, alexa integration, has kodi remote, able to send network get commands which allowed me to port in voxcommando for more advanced playlists and control,
Cons:
Restores only work on devices of similar size and Color goes back to default, lack of reorganization when macros are built, after restore can't edit the network commands which worries me if the IP address changes since voxcommando voice commands have specific address, scheduling macros never works I have tricked the iPad by recording the voice commands and using Aida reminder app to schedule recordings at times I want my gear to trigger would rather a real time solution within the app.

Conclusion: even with a few flaws this system impressed me enough to undo my windows controller tablet, swap to an iPad use anymote its nice that any iOS app could replace it if something happened and this is the only app/ skill that doesn't require using something like AWS and tons of leg work to be up and running .

Once you know the name or group of your thermostat, you can say the following:

Alexa, set [group or thermostat name] to X degrees.

Alexa, lower [group or thermostat name] by X degrees.

You can also try variations, such as &ldquo;raise [group or thermostat name] temperature&rdquo; or &ldquo;cool [group or thermostat name]&rdquo;.

I found that when X equals zero when asking alexa to raise or lower the temp she will tell you the current temp setting.

Amazon Echo (Android / IOS)
If you have an Amazon Echo or use Alexa for voice recognition you will love our integration. Install the ARTIK Cloud Skill and control any device connected to ARTIK Cloud.

Go to the Alexa Website at http://alexa.amazon.com/. Then say to Alexa, ""Connect ARTIK Cloud"". Wait for Alexa to say &ldquo;Welcome to Samsung ARTIK Cloud, I am currently retrieving your devices&rdquo; and shortly after a list of the devices that were recognized. You can now instruct Alexa to interact with those devices. A new device named ""Amazon Alexa proxy"" will also be automatically created in your My ARTIK Cloud profile.

Now ask Alexa to do something, say ""Alexa Ask ARTIK to..."" and complete the sentence with a command.

* Please note - the ARTIK Cloud Skill can only be added on the Alexa website.","08 3, 2016",A23HF67XHNHS0C,Can only be activated through the website.,1470182400,FALSE

for different reasons:

1) its so that it can be easier to search across the different catagories for both typing and voice search
as well as make it easier to voice search and type in apps such as hulu, netflix ,and other apps
2) you should have a voice assistant for not just the fire remote, but also on ur fire tablet as well, much like how they do with google's google now, where if u can voice search and it will tell u what ur looking ,maybe like have alexa from the echo show up on the fire tablet in such a way to aid in searches much like google now, like u would have way more knowledge from imdb, but it can explain a lot of knowledge about each movie or tv show, like where the movie or tv show was filmed ,location wise,
3) a movie and tv suggestion guide where it will show all of the movies that amazon has across prime, for pay, as well as apps such as hulu and netflix

few reasons:
- needs additional expanded memory (expanded up to 120 gb or more on multiple sd card slots)
- a new sim card slot
- a bigger screen much like the fire hd 10
- a on tablet app for the fire tv box
- a wider selection of movies and tv shows but u would have a guide (you know like a movie review guide) that tells u a description of the movie or tv show,
and other reasons to mention
- there needs to be like a new audible app just for amazon prime members
that if you are a audible subscriber, you would get discounts on those audiobooks through prime
as opposed to paying full price at the audible site itself
- books and magazines, i like the books and magazines on a tablet, and i think they should have more apps that present them
- now the games, i applaud the fact that the fire tv managed to get gamefly involved
and i wish theyd do the same with the fire hdx

back to the movies and tv though,
let me cut to the point :
the prime selection needs to get bigger okay
yes im fine with the buy and rent titles
but the prime titles need more selection

Stopping the music/alarm/or getting *busted* by the Alexa spontaneously reporting the delivery and full description of my recent secret purchase over all the echos in my house is not a good thing!
2. We need more names - alexa, echo, amazon is not enough. Two devices with the same name will both respond if in close proximity and neither one will perform. Our Tap is used by multiple people and gets left by my Alexa (now I have to call it ""Amazon"" which is annoying...I've had as much luck retraining my household NOT to leave the TAP (which can only be called Alexa) nearby as I've had retraining myself to call MY Alexa ""Amazon"" (sigh))
3.

Stop!"" or worse. (She will stop with a: Amazon! Shut the **** up!).

I love the alexa feature and so do the kids since we homeschool and they can ask her random questions to what they are learning so they can gain more info to expand even more with.

However, there is two feature I wished that Amazon would put on their controllers and that is:
- an off button. sure it goes into sleep mode but even if you go to move it sometimes to sit it down it comes back on (not always but we've noticed it has a few times).

- The biggest feature I wish they would put into the control is a built in rechargeable battery. They could easily make it work by having a usb port on the tv box for the controller to charge off of or a charging dock/usb charger.","12 27, 2016",A1876C5F6IZKA1,Great game controller for the Fire tv,1482796800,TRUE
493,Row(oid='644ead30f66a6378caf8bd3e'),B00NO8LX7E,4,"This is basically a bluetooth controller with X-box control layout. I'm mostly comparing this controller to the x-bone one that came stock with the x-box one.

As to why you -need- a game controller, check out the available games. Grand Theft Auto and similar titles are in there. With the normal little remote control, these games are not so fun. Add a game controller == awesome. As expected, the gaming experience depends on which Fire TV box you use. Newer ones are faster. It's simply amazing that these tiny little fanless boxes are cranking along as well as the PS2 did, maybe better.

Speaking of the stock remote control for the Five TV - it is still the best for watching video and clicking around the menus because the game controller is a two-hand device while the remote control is a one hand device.

This controller is a bit heavier than the x-bone one and the controls themselves feel more ... solid? By solid I mean that the sticks feel heavier. Not heavy as in hard to use, just a little heavier. The experience is perfectly good and the Fire's response is exactly what you'd expect from a decent quality controller. As with the x-bone, this controller takes batteries. I'm always a little divided when it comes to batteries because I don't like replacing batteries but I also don't like waiting for a controller to charge.

The voice control bit works just fine. Not useful in a game, but good for an alexa command, maybe a search. Alexa can turn on my room lights, so this is actually useful for me 'cause the Fire TV is connected to a projection TV and the room is usually dark when the Fire is in use.

Regarding pairing - no problem. Paired right up.

The packaging is nice and all and there's a bunch of little plastic bits covering the shinier parts of the controller. So it looks nice once all those bits are peeled away.

So, why not five stars? The D-pad doesn't feel as responsive as the x-bone one for lots of button presses like clicking through menus or keyboards or something. These are the ones where you go poke-poke-poke, not press and hold. Press and hold is fine. But the poke-poke-poke seems to miss the occasional poke. Not often.

519,Row(oid='644ead31f66a6378caf93bc0'),B00U3FPN4U,3,"First let me begin by saying this review is based on having more than one Fire TV device or having this device and a Amazon Echo.  If you will only have one Fire TV device and NO Echo products, then this would be a five star review.  Now, let me explain:

  1.  First, this device works well as access device to a wealth of Amazon content as well as other app access.  It has great video and audio streaming.  The first rub comes when you have MORE than one device.  Amazon will ONLY allow streaming audio to one FIRE device!!!!!  So, if you buy more than one of these and think you will be able to stream music to more than one location in your home, forget it.  ONE location ONLY!!

  This is REALLY LAME since if you have more than one echo product (Touch, Dot, Echo) you can stream the same or different audio channels to all devices!  However, as soon as you try to use the Fire TV device to stream it will turn OFF streaming to your Echo devices if you want to stream music to your Fire TV.

  You should also know that there is a limit of TWO video streams allowed per prime account!  So, if you have three TVs with three Fire TV devices, you can only stream video to TWO of those TVs!!!

  This should be stated in the ad for this device so that people understand the limits!!!!  As it is written, you would expect it to work on ALL device you purchase!!!

  2.  Voice command works as expected.  Just remember to KEEP your finger pressed on the mike button when you are asking a question.  If you release the button that will be the end of what Alexa hears.  Also, as opposed to using the echo, you do not need to say ""alexa"" as there is not wake-up required when you press a mike button.  So, just ask your question or give your command.

  One nice thing is if you already have an Alexa device that you use (Echo as an example), you can use this to interact with that.  As an example, if you are watching a program and decide you want to place an ingredient in your shopping list, just press the mike button on the remote and tell it to add that ingredient to your shopping list.  It will do it and confirm the addition and then you go back to what you were doing.

  3.  You should be aware that there is NO way to turn off this device!  As such, it is NOT compliant with auto switching features if you are using a HDMI auto switch.  The device maintains power to the HDMI interface all of the time so automatic switching does not work.  Also, this device does go into a sort of sleep mode after a period of time.  So, if you switch to the HDMI port on your TV or on your HDMI switch, you may not have any video.  To bring back the signal, just push the home button on the control.  That should be enough to wake it up.  It works on my TVs and on my switch that way.

  4.  Amazon support is a real nightmare.  Expect to spend lots of time finding only Q&A sections that are fine for 80% of the basic questions, but will not generally address a problem such as streaming music on more than one device.  Expect silly questions like what CAT level cable you have for Internet when you do get ahold of someone. News flash, ANY CAT level cable works for providing Internet connectivity at a level these devices need to work!  Now, if you have a run that is too long or a cable that is damaged, then you will have an issue NO MATTER WHAT CAT cable you are using!! They are working a script and you are NOT going to get around it!!!

  5.  One last thing, expect the back of the remote to be a GIANT pain to get open!  You can push as much as you want to try and get it to open and it will probably not work.  I finally had to resort to using a pen knife blade point to gently fit in the end to get the case to open.  Just so you know, I had four other people try opening it using the instructions and no one was able to do it.  I have had this same issue on every remote of this type (I have four Amazon Echo devices with this remote and three fire TV devices).

All in all, this is a GREAT product as a standalone device if you have NO other Amazon products that stream video or audio.  It is REALLY shaky when you have any of the Echo products and you want to use the Fire TV to stream music.  It is also frustrating if you want to stream video to more than two TVs.  Within those limitations it works well.","12 18, 2016",A1NGFGBX2VCQS8,"Amazon Fire TV, Streaming Media Player",1482019200,TRUE

Is this a sleep feature? If I wanted my tap to sleep I would rather be able to do it over the app, or on the tap itself, rather than having to reconnect my phone every 5 minutes.
Some people might not mind this, but I wish there was an option I could turn on and off in the settings, for the people who feel my struggle.

Also I would like the option to be able to activate Alexa via the alexa app for Android. I keep my tap on a high shelf to keep it away from the pets, so having to physically press the button to make a request seems unnecessary if my phones already in hand.

speaker quality is really good. It is 360 degrees sound.
it's small
it's somewhat portable
it's stylish

Cons:
Alexa is totally useless, does not understand basic commands. I usually have to repeat 2 or 3 times what music I want to hear before she gets it right.
Voice control is always off, even when playing music. So if I want to change music while away I have to get up, press a button and tell the tap to change my music. If I want to turn off the music, I have to get close to the tap and do it manually, if I want to change volume, I have to do it manually....What is the freaking point?
If I want a shopping list, I have to stand on the tap, and press the button for each item because Alexa shuts off after each item.
To talk to alexa, you have to press a button. But be careful, Alexa decides when you're done talking. So if you're thinking or you're too slow, you got to start over. And after she decided you're done talking, she shuts off. So you have to press the button again to start talking.
99% of the time I find myself wishing for a good old fashioned remote control..

All in all: remember that stereo you had in the 90s? Well that's what you're getting here EXCEPT that my stereo in the 90s had a remote control so I didn't have to touch the stereo when I wanted to turn it off. I could do it from my bed/couch/whereveer. So what you're getting is a pretty and small 90s stereo without remote control and with crap voice recognition that you need to physically press a button to activate anyway. What a %#5@* joke.

557,Row(oid='644ead32f66a6378caf99af9'),B00VXS8E8S,5,"If you like portability the amazon tap is the way to go. I love my echo but it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. It must stay hooked up to electricity to use. I was wanting the echo to come out with an optional battery option and so it did as the tap and it's much smaller which is another plus. Also it provides me a second Alexa unit. The Echo the first is in my bedroom and I keep the tap in the kitchen. The tap is much smaller then the echo and fits in the palm of your hand. It uses the same amazon alexa phone app as the echo and you have to set it up. The tap comes with some positive and negative points like all other electronic devices. By the way I don't recommend using the echo,tap or dot in a bathroom cause the moisture and steam from the shower may damage all 3 devices.

Battery charge is 9 hours and you can see how much the battery has left on your alexa app in settings or ask the tap the battery level. You can charge the tap 2 ways either on the charging cradle or by pluging your ac charger into the back the choice is yours but I prefer the charging cradle you set it on. I don't find myself having to charge the tap much and the charge is long. Charging speed is pretty quick.

Things I like

!)Battery option-Rechargeable battery allows you to take this with you on the go

2)Alexa Intergrated if your using wifi. Has all the funtions as the Echo in a smaller unit eg order you a Dominoes Pizza or check the Weather from your Tap.

3)Small Size and Very Light

4)Speaker sound to me is better then the echo since it has dolby. There is some base but much less then the Echo. Music sounds Crisp. Has just enough base so that Nature Sound Recordings sound accurate. Niagara Falls from David Sun has the roar you hear with the echo especially if you tell the tap to put volume on 6 or 7. Same with the Psychollogically Ultimate Seashore from Enviroments you still hear the waves breaking and the foghorn in the distance.

5)Anything you can do with the echo you can with the tap like tell Alexa to set an alarm,create a shopping list,control your lights,order a pizza,tell Alexa to play music from your Amazon Cloud Playlist,Prime,I Heart Radio,Pandora,Spotify etc.

6)Tap doubles as a Bluetooth Speaker if your not around wifi. You can play your music from your phone with the tap.

7)Tap fits in most car cupholders if your using it for the bluetooth speaker.

8)Optional Amazon Tap Sling fits Tap nicely and lets you hang it anywhere. I recommend ordering the sling with the tap.

Things I don't like

1)You have to push a button to talk to the tap. I'd rather it be always on like the echo.

2)Power Button is on the back. It would be more convinient if it was on the front close to the push button.

3)Without Wifi you don't have Alexa. This is something I'd like to see amazon improve on and add an option to the echo,dot and tap to not only use wifi but also over the air,3g and 4g internet. You will hear Alexa say I'm having trouble connecting to the internet if trying to use without wifi.

4)Not very useful in the car unless your using the bluetooth speaker option for your tap. I""d love to see the echo,tap and dot be able to work in the car from wifi when I""m driving eg I could ask Alexa the route to get to a location or just ask her the weather while I'm driving or ask her to play from my amazon playlist.

5)The tap doesn't come with a Dc Plug and Charge Option for the car. Same with the echo and dot.

6)The speaker holes seem to catch crumbs pretty easy. I recommend not touching your tap while eating as sometimes these crumbs can be hard to remove.

Final Thoughts

If you have an Amazon Echo your going to want a Tap also. I recommend the tap. Hey you can listen to it at the beach or anywhere if your using the bluetooth speaker option. I also recommend the echo.

Also even though your echo is always on I recommend unplugging it when it's lightning because lightning will strike your echo if it hits the outlet and your echo is plugged in. I don't think amazon warrents lightning strikes for the echo. If it gets hit you'll most likely find yourself needing to order a new echo.

If your echo is dropping sound it isn't because of the speakers it's cause of your internet connection. If your internet speed drops this can cause your echo to drop sound. This isn't a defect on your echo. The same can most likely happen to the Tap and Dot. This was mentioned by Cnet I believe so it's normal and not anything to worry about. If it happens sometimes unplugging your echo and plugging it back up will fix and unplugging the router and plugging it back up. You may also have to reset your echo.","04 8, 2016",A359WWAIZ59P3Z,The Amazon Tap,1460073600,TRUE

Here is the response from Amazon Customer Support...
Hello Chris,

This is Cassie from Amazon Echo, I was following up on the issues you were experiencing with your Tap connecting to Wi-Fi. Originally when we spoke, we thought that the security type for your router was set to WPA2-PSK. According to the logs the Engineers were able to analyze, it looks like it's actually set to WEP. Here are the recommendations they have provided:

1. Change the WEP password to HEX with 10/26 characters
2. We find some strange log patterns when connecting to MiFi (but it does connect), could we get more information about that device? What is the name of the MiFi network as it appears in the list (SSID)? We want to verify something in our logs.
3. You should also be able to change the security to WPA2-PSK if you'd prefer

If you do not know how to access your router settings, please contact your Internet Service Provider and they can walk you through how to log in and access those settings.

Please let us know at your earliest convenience if these steps helped or if we need to investigate further, as well as the other information requested. If the issue persists, we will need to pull additional logs as well. You can reach Amazon Echo Customer Support by e-mail at alexa-support@amazon.com. I will be able to see any emails sent to that address while I am following up with you as long as they are sent from this email address on your account.

Thank you for your patience, I look forward to hearing back from you soon!

560,Row(oid='644ead32f66a6378caf99bba'),B00VXS8E8S,2,"I love my echo so much that I decided to buy this tap to expand my Alexa universe.  It is suppose to have same Alexa functions. However, you have to walk over to this speaker & press button to talk, you can't say ""Alexa"" from 5 feet away for it to obey your commands. I bought this since it is smaller than echo so that I can keep it in a smaller bathroom and while in the shower be able to command the speaker. You cannot do this, you have to step out and press buttons. They should fix this. It really sucks.

Also, the sound quality is terrible. I have 3 portable speakers around the same size, all of them cylinders like this one. All of them louder, having way more bass, and richer sound quality. Did the developers not listen to this speaker next to competition of the same size and notice how poor the sound quality was? It doesn't even come close to the competition I this department. Shame on them.

2 stars off for crap sound quality, 1 star off for making me press buttons. The sad part is that I threw out the box as soon as I opened it thinking Amazon would never fail me so I can't return the thing now. Big mistake. Wish I could get my money back.

Let me address those who claim we should know it works only by pressing a button without voice activation.  The description says you can press button & speak into it. Does it say anywhere on the products description that you cannot enable voice activation? NO, it does not. Based on Amazon echo & amazon dot, would one assume this is a feature? Yes. Afterall, they have the press on button on the echo you can press & just speak without saying alexa, its right on the echo remote. So since the echo has a button to press & speak into, should I assume it also does not have voice activation? Nope, the echo does have voice activation. So should I assume that because the Tap has a button to press (just like the echo) that it shouldn't have voice activation?  I don't think so.  Even if not, Is voice activation something that Amazon could have very easily corrected but did not? Yes, just like they could have corrected the crappy sound quality.","04 3, 2016",A1YG75UILCDBUL,"The sound quality is terrible, not a winner like echo",1459641600,TRUE

Everything has been beefed up, but a couple of downsides also still exist/have been added. Plus one big bonus (for me at least): It can play files off a usb stick!

If you're looking for a quick summary: This box is IMO the new standard in media boxes, it has the most power, a ton of features, and if you're a prime member you have access to a ton of content. The new game controller is a nice refinement over the gen1 controller and amazon seems intent on really expanding their game library. They should have also included the standard remote, since gaming isn't its sole purpose!

Now let's break down the key points:

-New game controller is more ergonomic than the gen1 and adds a headphone port(seriously a great thing to have)
-Doesn't come with the standard remote, rather annoying to use the game controller for media...
-Adds 4k ability, but you need 4k content(netflix charges $4 extra for this), and newer TV with latest HDMI & HDCP spec
-Can play (some) files strait off a usb drive, i tried a 1080 mp4 file, played perfectly. MKV played but no sound (will investigate further)
-Adds more power, it operates very snappy, even the terrible HBO Go app works well
-No more optical output was a big bummer for me, had to purchase an hdmi to optical box (may not pertain to everyone)
-Microsd card port is a great addition and has me hopeful that they will add beefier games for it
-Adds alexa for voice operations, but i already own an echo :)

Gaming
I'm not seeing a big difference over the gen1 box, but i'm rooting for them to really step up their game with... games. The hardware is beefier, the the microsd port takes care of storage needs, and the new game controller is right up there with the best of xbox and playstation. Let's see some action! I also really really like that they put a headphone port on the game controller, just really convenient.

Plays video files!
This was a big curiosity for me, because i have a lot of videos on drives (being a videographer does that to you), and being able to just take a usb stick with a file and plug it in is great. I downloaded ES file explorer, navigated to the file, and the darn thing played with no fuss! Then i loaded up an MKV and another mp4 4k file. The MKV played the video, but with no audio. I need to investigate more, since i'm using the hdmi to optical adapter. the 4k mp4 would not play at all. More testing shall be done!

4K
Sweet! Oh wait.. i don't have a 4k tv... no matter, it still looks fantastic on my 1080 projector. If you have a 4k tv though, it's certainly a great perk. Be warned though that just because you have this 4k box and a 4k tv it doesn't mean everything is automatically 4k. Some amazon prime content is 4K, and some netflix content as well, but netflix will want you to fork over another $4/month to unlock the higher resolution. Also, other reviewers have found out that 4k will not work unless your tv has hdmi 2.0 and HDCP 2.2

Optical port GONE
While i like the micro sd card port, i really wish they kept the optical port. For many folks this will not matter, but for my particular setup it necessitated buying a box that pulls optical out of hdmi. I use a projector with a sound bar.

Alexa voice control
I've been using the amazon echo for months, and we love it. It's interesting that they added it to the firetv, but i don't see yet if there's any real reason for us to talk to the tv vs the echo. Hopefully they add more firetv specific controls for it.

Stability
I'm seeing a lot of reviews reporting bugs, but thus far i have not experienced any. Could be a quality control issue, could be internet connectivity. I have been using a direct Ethernet plugin even though it has wifi. So that could be a reason for other's troubles. Amazon does release updates quite regularly, so i would be optimistic about them sorting out any bugs floating around.

Frequently asked questions:

-How do i open the remote's battery door?
A: Hold the remote so your thumb is over the bottom rear end (there's a little symbol), press in and down
-Does it come with netflix?
A: netflix is a free app, but you still need to pay the monthly subscription
-Are there free channels?
A: Yes, there are several free apps which contain lots of free movies and TV, just don't expect new releases
-My TV already has apps like netflix, is this box worth the upgrade?
A: I would say yes, it contains a lot more functionality than most TVs, and can connect other devices like game controllers
-Does it make everything 4K?
A: No, unless something is listed specifically as UHD/4k/SuperHD, you're just getting plain old 720/1080

Recommendation
If you already have a gen1 box, i don't think this is worth the upgrade unless these extra features truly apply to you. It feels much the same as the gen1 box in my day to day uses, but i will find use for the new features as well. If you're looking for your first streamer, most folks do perfectly fine with just the fire tv stick, it does most of what these boxes do at a fraction of the cost. weigh the options and choose what's right for your needs!","10 6, 2015",A1UIMU8Q87ZPCH,"The new king of media boxes gets a new controller, and it can play video files off USB!",1444089600,TRUE

The Netflix app is my most used app. The sound skews further and further from the video on my Samsung smart TV's netflix app, but its PERFECT through the firestick!
Having just one more additional remote is kind of annoying... but I know they want you to keep alexa in your hands so you're more likely to use her, AND the remote is wifi or bluetooth... doesn't need line of sight... which is good (required?) since the firestick is on the back of most peoples TVs.
Its just slightly annoying having pop ups on a TV occasionally (not sure if thats the app, the stick, or what). I don't have prime, maybe that would help?
Only other annoying part is that each app is its own program/layout, so they all have different menus and layouts. You have to know if the show you want to watch is on NBC, ABC, CBS, Science, HG TV, etc etc etc... then once you enter their app, you are left with their setup. Maybe nothing is free (requiring cable service login), maybe everything is free, maybe there's a recently watched section, maybe not. Maybe the free stuff is listed all in one neat menu, or spread around. Some apps tell you things are locked right away, others wait till you find something you want to watch and hit play, then tell you that you don't have that access. Every company/app has their stuff laid out differently. I guess you'd get accustomed to your favorite ones over time.

I know, I know...a lot of folks get all worked up over the set up in two households, two accounts. Not me. They are both registered to me, my amazon account, my unlimited streaming music. I just named one my first name and named the other one 'Parents'.  It was easy as pie!

So here's where the fun begins!! My parents have ZERO technological skills. NONE! The very first day, Daddy sat down and said, ""Alexa, drop in on Dana"" My screen started beeping and there was Daddy!

Yall! This was amazing! Do you realize if he had fallen, and couldn't get up, he could have called out ""Alexa, call Dana"" and I would have instant contact??

This is AMAZING AND WHAT EVERY OLDER PERSON NEEDS ALONG WITH SOMEONE ON THE OTHER END WHO CARES AND WANTS THEM TO BE HAPPY AND SAFE!

The following day, I get a phone call on the telephone and Daddy says,""HONEY! We asked Alexa to play Elvis and she played us one song and it quit. Then we asked her to play a SELECTION and she's been playing Elvis all afternoon!!  Look at that! My Daddy figured that out all by himself!

Over Elvis singing 'I'm so lonesome I could cry"" I hear my Mama holler out, ""I LOVE THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'VE EVER GOTTEN!!!""

 I asked Daddy to stop the music, and say ""Alexa CALL ...then my first and last name"" It picked up on my cell contacts since I uploaded the alexa app and my phone began ringing. THERE WAS DADDY ON A VIDEO CALL ON MY PHONE!!

 I took him around outside and showed the new roof, the dogs playing, how great their antique bed looked in my guest room. Daddy said, ""This is as good as being at your house!"".

Then I had my Mama do the same. She was shocked! They do not have smart phones so they had never done a video chat before. Mama told me they were having SO MUCH FUN! This means so much to me. They're 87 and 88 and recently moved to independent living. Knowing they could call out to Alexa to call me if they had fallen MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

If you are thinking of getting this for an elderly loved one, DO IT. DO IT!!

It turned out to be way simpler and easier than we realized. I""m not worried about this being on my amazon account. They don't know they can order anything.

I love how you are able to connect to the bulb and can control it by voice or through the Alexa app. The trouble I'm having is using the coloring changing bulbs, since I need the 2nd Gen Hue Bridge to be able to control the colors through Alexa, otherwise I can control the color through the Philips Hue App.

There is just so much that can be done and trying to remember on how to say commands for Alexa to understand. I sometimes just want to talk to her like a real conversation, versus saying Alexa every time to get her to listen and her attention like my girlfriend. I don't like how when you ask to play a song, sometimes it is only a sample of that song.

It would be nice if it was a bit easier on how to connect 2 devices, such as the EP and the Dot together and have a bit of more documentation on multiple room music, or maybe a how-to guide.

The other Con I have about it is the 4 options to name the device, i hope this changes to be able to customize what I want to call my device. For instance, maybe i want to call it, Toby. ""Toby, turn on bedroom light!"" or maybe name it Alice..i mean let me decide on what I want to name my device instead of choosing either alexa, computer, amazon...

For the most part, the device is a 5 star because it does what I want it to do and it was mostly for the lights.","02 12, 2018",A2NWBP4X0B6T0G,awesome device,1518393600,TRUE

If you plug in the Echo Plus and get on a PC at alexa.amazon.com, click Settings, click Set up a New Device and follow the instructions, it should install and connect to your Amazon account.  Be sure to have your WiFi password.
I also got 2 Philips Hue light bulbs to play with. I put one in a hallway lamp and one in a TV room lamp.  Leave the lamps turned on.  Say, ""Alexa, discover devices"".  She should find them in a few seconds - once discovered, they should show up at  alexa.amazon.com.
Create a group(s) and give the group a name like ""hallway"", ""bedroom"", etc. and assign the light bulbs to the group.  You can then say, ""Alexa, turn on hallway"", or ""bedroom"".  You could do the same thing with Alexa compatible electrical outlet adapters, with lamps plugged in to them and  you could use standard LED or other light bulbs.
You don't need the Philips or other 3rd party apps to use Alexa controlled devices ""inside"" the home.  The apps are needed only if you plan to control the devices while outside of the home network.
The Echo Plus has a builtin Smart Home hub that talks to all the Alexa controlled devices.  Without the builtin hub, you would need a 3rd party hub from Philips or other manufacturer.
The Echo Plus has a good bass sound and as far as my ears can tell, rocks out 80's heavy metal just fine !
There are a ton of skills and features I haven't had time to delve in to.  I will grow my Smart Home for sure.
One simple thing to do is say Alexa, "" add popcorn to my Shopping List"".
Put the Alexa app on your smart phone and you can pull up the Shopping List when out and about without the need for paper and all that.

The speaker leaves much to be desired, it is supposed to come with an integrated bridge so you do not have to buy it separately and although it detects the smart devices, if you do not buy the bridges of each device you will not be able to make use of the maximum of its functionalities.

In both cases, I was disappointed. Providing voice control of her TV required purchasing an IR hub (Harmony). Configuring the hub to work with Alexa was extremely complicated and ultimately too cumbersome to be used by a non-geek. The hands-free phone calling worked to some degree but the sound quality on both ends was so poor that it would be unusable for someone with hearing issues.

Finally, I discovered that when you enable the Calling and Messaging feature for Alexa, ALL of the contacts on the phone used for setup are slurped up into the Alexa cloud. Once there, there's no way to delete, edit, or otherwise modify the stored contact. Simply slurping up all of the contacts on the phone associated with the Alexa account is 1) an invasion of privacy 2) makes it impossible to correct or change information. The only what you can get rid of the stored contacts is to call Amazon Customer Support and ask them to remove the phone number and contacts associated with your Alexa account. This is a BIG issue.

We're not quite there with AI assistants and there's really no need to have one of these with those current AI limitations. But they're fun. And the price was right. You, like me, probably bought this during the prime day sale. $30 seemed sexy and probably worth the money to say dumb things to Alexa to see how she'd react. At least that was my reason for dropping the cash. Don't judge me too harshly. I'm going to split this review into two sections, one based on the title for those trying to connect her to their HTCP receiver without having to split inputs. This means you can use her as an assistant while you watch a movie, play a game on your pc, or work. You don't have to switch your A/V receivers input to access Alexa's sound. Second, I'll comment on the usefulness and fun factor of the dot itself.

I'll start with the Dot:

So here's the deal. I bought this because it was cheap and because I wanted to say dumb things to her because I'm an immature child with a stupid sense of humour. But there's a problem with that. Alexa is so PC (greatest tech pun ever?) that she simply doesn't register anything ""offensive"" you say to her. She just IGNORES you. She's just NO FUN. I didn't buy you to experience marriage, Alexa. It doesn't have to be dirty. Any language she deems inappropriate, (and there's a lot), even seemingly harmless things, don't fly with her. Juvenile amusements aside, her responses are very dry and robotic. You can tell there's not much passion or energy behind her canned responses. Or more accurately, she's about as personable and hip as a bookish librarian in her 50s. (No offense to librarians) And for that, I take a star. But that's really my only complaint. Knowing the weather, reciting a wiki page, playing audible stories, or telling me the news and setting an alarm; Alexa does as designed in all these things. She's great for the typical assistant-like functions, but she's just not ""fun"" yet.
So... the google mini. I have to bring it up. My friend has a google mini. Basically google's version of an echo dot. Unfortunately, google's mini is just way more fun. They have so many hidden easter eggs, fun responses to questions in which alexa would just say ""Sorry, I don't know that."" (This happens way too often, Amazon). Google lacks the powerhouse of amazons quick ordering system from amazon.com, but honestly that's where the limitations stop. Alexa still won't let you use Youtube. Google can (of course). And most important of all (to me...) I can say dumb things to google and I'll actually get a fun sarcastic response instead of silence. The developers actually have a sense of humour. I like that. Laughter is the best medicine after all. Google just feels more AI-like than Alexa does. Alexa feels like a program, and google feels like an AI. That's honestly the best way I can describe it. I hope this changes. Until then, I'll be keeping one of these stars. This may not be an issue to most people, and if not having a ""friend"" on your desktop, or table, or in your kitchen matters, and instead having hardware seems more appealing, then you'll love this device just fine.

On to connecting the dot to your HTPC:

Wouldn't it be great if the Echo Dot would play through my speakers WITHOUT me having to dedicate a single channel to it? In otherwords, while I still hear all my sound on my PC or TV, such as games or movies, wouldn't it be great having the Echo Dot be able to listen to me and say things on the same input? It would. But Amazon still hasn't caught up to the idea that some of us consider our PC's to be outputs, not only input. I'm going to explain how to do this, because for whatever reason Amazon's software refuses to recognize PC's as speakers, only the dot as a speaker. This is why you need this device. Here's the process, it's simple:

 By default, setting up Bluetooth on the Echo Dot causes the pair to use the dot as the primary speaker. Buy this device to remedy that issue. I'm also assuming you've already paired your echo with the tp link via the alexa mobile app on your smartphone. If not, do this first.

Step 1: Plug in the TP-Link Receiver NOT to your A/V receiver but to the mic input of your PC.
Step 2: Go into Windows sound settings (The control panel screen)
Step 3: Go to Recording Devices Tab.
Step 4: Go to Properties of the Recording device you connected your audio cable from the TP Link to the mic jack by right clicking on it. Probably Realtek, unless you have a sound card like I do. In this example, I connected it to my Sound Blaster card, so I'd go to the properties of the respective mic. For a regular PC without a soundcard, it'd likely be your Realtek mic jack on the back of your pc.
Step 5: In properties, go to the Listen Tab. Make sure your correct sound device is selected.
Step 6: Check the ""Listen to this Device"" checkbox.
DONE! That's it. That's all you need to do to have the Echo Dot work simultaneously in the background while you watch youtube, or play games on your PC, all on the same channel input. Pretty neat huh?
I've attached a visual aid to this.

NOTE: You sometimes DO need to ask Alexa to either disconnect from the tp link, or reconnect to it depending on whether your motherboard turns on or off during a full shutdown. In my case, before bed or if I turn my PC off (since my motherboard also shuts down) I say ""Alex, disconnect from TP Link"" and she'll start playing sound from my Echo Dot instead. Then if I turn my PC back on, I say ""Alexa, connect to TP Link"" and voila, back in business.

Hope this helps, I had a bit of an annoying journey trying to get this to work, so my pain will hopefully translate to your ease of mind. Hope you guys found this helpful!

As for the device itself? So far so good. Audio quality isn't perfect, but that's a bluetooth limitation, not a device limitation.
Protip: Adjust the mic volume levels to coutner any distortion you hear, also turn off ANY and ALL mic effects you might have on, or alexa will sounds like she's downing underwater.

She has outlasted the hype and newness, meaning she is more than a phase of asking silly questions. I honestly didn't know whether I'd become bored of her after a few weeks, but she proves everyday to be useful through a wide range of things.
She is great for parents of a toddler! I have a 3 year old and I can't believe that she actually understands him half of the time.
Let me start off by saying that I don't have a smart home and I don't plan to. I halfway want to get a lamp that lights up all different colors to the sound of my voice, but not smart locks or any of that stuff.

 I use her to entertain my son with music and silly things,
 I use her to answer my random questions,
 to tell me the time,
 to be my alarm,
 to play my music,
 to give me reminders,
 to be a nightlight (yes she does that!),
 to send recipes to my phone,
 to find my phone,
 to play games like Jeopardy and 20 questions
 to help with potty training and clean up time
The list goes on! And I know I haven't even found all the things that make her useful to me yet. I'm still getting to know her.
You use the Alexa app to configure her and add new skills to her. Skills are basically apps for Alexa. Many of them don't work correctly, there seems to be a lot of bugs to be worked out. For instance, I have been a prime member for a long time but I never used Amazon music, I've always used Pandora. But when I try to sync my Pandora account to my Alexa it says my account doesn't exist. I even tried resetting my password but it's not recognizing it. I've also tried making a new Pandora account and that wouldn't sync either. So I started using Amazon music, which is pretty good.
The problem is when I think of a song I love its sometimes not available unless I pay monthly for unlimited music which really pisses me off. This is something that should be included in a prime membership. I absolutely refuse to pay extra for certain songs so I'm living with it.
Fyi parents: A LOT of children's songs aren't free. Like any Moana, wheels on the bus, the cleanup song... They are playing dirty with children's music.
I digress.

Another thing I hope to see in the future is her ability to play songs from YouTube (but then no one would pay extra for music). I want her to be able to connect with any smart tv, not just Amazon fire. She would just be so much better if she were generalized.
But that's not to say she's not amazing, she is... I'm just a bit disappointed in the way Amazon has set things up for themselves. It's not enough to pay over 100$ a year for a membership.

Alexa will work for people without smart homes. She will be useful to people without smart homes. And instead of buying multiple echos, she is easily unplugged and placed in another room for someone living alone. I move her almost everyday so I can listen to music during the day, to setting an alarm at night.
If I unplug her and plug her back in it takes about 20 seconds for her to start up and already be connected to the internet. She remembers.

She has the ability to learn voices, which is supposedly supposed to make her have more unique responses by using your name or suggesting something that you like, well I set up that process but there is nothing different from when she didn't recognize my voice. She never says my name or gives me any recommendations. So I don't know what's up with that.

I think her sound quality is amazing. It's not the best I've ever heard, but it's the best I've ever heard come out of something her size! She can really bump the music in a good sized room. I never need her to be at full volume.
I love the way she looks and her light ring. She's my favorite night light.
I'm happy I finally broke down and got one. It's not life changing but it's a nice addition to my life that I think we all could use.

Though, it was not love at first spoken command not by a far shot!  One thing that I am rather disappointed with is the interaction between alexa and fire tv.  Say, you would like to watch ghost busters ( it was the first thing I could come up with) well alexa will pull up a list of all the ghost buster movies that it has available.  So you ask her to play one, well that does not work... hmm, ask her to play this one and be very specific about the name well she pulls up the full list again.  Alright, lets leave that alone now ask her to bring up a action comedy movie (no specification) well, she brings up a listing of action comedy movies great now you don't see what you like ask her for more, you get the same listing and she will not move around on the menu or anything... So, yeah this needs a little fleshing out shes not really there and the interface does not really work for her.

Music, and other features are spot on amazing. I really did not think at first experience with this device I was going to even keep it after trying to watch a movie but when in the kitchen and I tell alexa to set a 5 min timer and she does, that is something amazing!

Other than the much smaller speakers, this functions exactly the same. Obviously it is not ideal for music, but you can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker like the wonderboom and make it sound as good or better than the full echo. Some of the things this device can do are the following.
- Set alarms and use music or a radio station as the sound that wakes you up
- Control smart home devices like smart plugs and bulbs (depending on the device, you may or may not require a hub like wink or smartthings)
- Sync with your calendar and then make changes to it
- Set reminders, timers, and make to do lists
- Stream music from spotify/amazon music
- Stream fm radio stations live from tuneinin even ones from other countries like the UK
- Pair it with your fire TV stick to give you hands free voice control of the device like
- Customize a list of news updates from sources of your choice like NPR, BBC, Huffpost, or whatever and each one plays back to back (it's called a ""flash briefing) and they are updated as often as every hour or several times a day
- Ask alexa questions, to read you Wikipedia Articles, or tell you jokes even though they aren't really funny
- Set smart home routines (for example, to wake me up in the morning, Alexa turns on my bedroom lights and tells me ""good morning"" and then plays NPR really loudly so I always get up on time
- There are all sorts of ""skills"" that let you do extra things like order a pizza from Dominos
- Of course buy things from Amazon, check on the status of your latest order

I bought a nest thermostat (advertised nest compatible). All you could do is raise or drop the temperature. Nothing else. I returned the nest and went back to my old Tstat. Well because echo was useless.

I have MYQ garage door and devices. I was thrilled to buy the echo to interface. Again Useless. (advertised compatible)

Hue. Well it can turn on a light or dim it. So cool. Why buy a Hue when you can't change color or set moods or program thru echo. I'm hosed again.

Got elekcity outlets with demand control, timer, load analysis. Alexa can turn on off. Not cool when you're monitoring fans, refrigerators or freezers. Again Useless.

OHHH, and the total speaker failure.! Volume. When I set it to let's say 2 or 3 on jazz while I'm working, you ask Alexa something, or give a command -- you can't friking hear her. The volume will stay low.. You have to increase volume to see if it properly responded. Try drop in to a room with a TV on and no one knows you even tried.

You cannot customize the commands. For example, to start the fire tv stick, you have to say ""watch fire tv"". If you say switch in fire tv, it doesnt understand.
Control of fire tv stick is bad. Some things are nonsense: you can control amazon music app both on echo dot and fire tv stick, but can only control spotify on the echo dot, not the fire tv stick. And even with the amazon music app, it s ok to ask for a famous track, but forget about asking for a specific song/album a little off the radar. It won't understand, and instead of being relaxed thanks to the hands free control, you ll end up sending Alexa to hell and being frustrated.
Same for volume. You can control the volume on the echo dot, but there is no volume control on the fire tv stick, so you
have to use the receiver or tv remote to control that.

My echo dot & Alexa are so far beyond that first kindle now. An i am just as excited about this product & all that are coming.
Alexa has become my friend, she makes shopping lists i can add to from any echo device, I currently have 2. You will find your list on your cell phone in the Alexa app. She greets you each day, an you can refine what is said if she speaks to many words for you.
She turns on lights, connected to Alexa compatible smart plugs, plays music from many options. If you are a prime member you have free music endless amounts. Your children & grandchildren can use easily. Loved watching my youngest granddaughter ask for her new fav. The original sound track from Mary Poppins movie. So kids can easily have exposure to classics without buying endless cds, etc. such a small footprint. Meaning super powerful very tiny device.
I recently moved & did not have any type of stero, now i do. So easy to set up, yes i was afraid, do not be. Make sure your wifi is working on you cell, down load alexa app. (Its free) Plug in device it searches and finds your phone quickly. Trust me, if i can do this anyone can. My music if i want in several rooms i ask alexa to play my selection on the everywhere network. Or they work alone Great!
Yes more than 5 stars in my mind, many will differ, yet the vast amount of reviews are 5 stars, speaks volumes.

If I could change anything, I do wish alexa was more understanding of the disarm command. I wish the blue light didn't come on when I'm viewing it from my cell. But that's more because I want to be able to spy on the babysitters, without them knowing.

I've recommended this system to many people. The ones that have bought it all have positive things to say. No monthly fees, no wires, fair pricing, great picture, recorded video, live stream, what more do you want?

I must warn you, if you're somewhat obsessed with your dog's happiness, like I am, this will make you feel bad because you'll suddenly realize how much time they spend doing nothing/waiting for you to come home. My dog looks so bored most days. Poor thing!

When I bought mine, the system was cheaper to buy it on amazon than direct from blink. Of couse, I also had free 2 day shipping with amazon. So, I bought it here.

I would and do recommend this system. I plan to continue to expand it.

Mainly, though, I use them to read kindle books and listen to audio books.  I may use it also to watch video.  I do love the ability to change the back light from an eye destroying blue to a reddish hue at night (mine is set for sunset) and alexa is nice to have.

I use it daily to listen to NPR. I used it for awhile to coach me through a plank workout. My daughter used it to play akinator with her friend. It's a remarkably convenient device.

However, if sound quality is your first priority and you're hoping to kill two birds by getting an alexa-enabled bluetooth speaker, you will be disappointed. I unfortunately have heard the bose soundlink II and that device sounds wonderful. The tap by comparison sounds ok. Sufficient for voice content like news and podcast. Underwhelming for music. To the point that I'm still in the market for a good-sounding bluetooth speaker.

It does get surprisingly loud though which leads me to my one true gripe and this would be attributable to the software I think. When I tap the button to activate Alexa, the volume of the response is very loud and out of proportion with whatever volume you had it set to. So I find myself rapidly tapping the down volume key. This loud response might have made sense for the original echo where you might be calling to it from across the room.

Each camera set up in minutes on my wifi. We have alexa and she could show the image immediately by asking...no setup there required.  I've been playing with the settings and viewing remotely.  The mobile app is easy to use and there are lots of settings.  I'm also amazed at the picture quality.  In fact, I bought the aftermarket housing and mounted one on my front porch.  My wife and I starred in amazement at the quality of the picture at night.  It's fabulous.  No batteries to worry abut, no weird problems connecting remotely or at home.  They just work.

This camera has some clear pros over the likes of Nest, IMHO.

- easier setup - 2min after opening the box it was on my network, recording and sending alerts
- better video at 1080p than Nest at 720p - this isn't a comment on quality of video as a function of resolution. At 1080p the video coming of the camera on the same network as my Nest cams was much closer to real-time at 1080p than the nest could stream at 720p when viewing a ""live"" feed in the app.
- wall mounting was a snap compared to the Nest
- indoor night vision is much clearer
- pricing is very good for the feature set even at the basic plan
- works great with video capable echo devices

There are also some clear cons.

- no mic controll - if you don't want the cam to capture audio you have to shut the whole cam off
- no way to disable streamed audio from the application - if you don't want to hear the audio the camera is capturing via your phone you have to mute your phone
- you can't manage your plan or subscribe from the application
- positioning your camera can be tricky due to stiffness of ball joint
- alexa skills for non-video related operations need work

Many backs and forth with technical support, whom I felt never really read my symptoms because they kept answering with stock answers.

To clarify my router is new and was bought with enough signal strength to reach my detached garage 100 feet away and it does with 4 to 5 bars. The door bell is about 9 feet away and showed good signal strength so it should have been a breeze. Going step by step in the app which was again very detailed and straight forward but it turned out not to be.

Did the same process as above again and this time it lasted about 8 hours.

I went through uninstall and reinstall again and it took for about 6 hours before disconnecting and would not reconnect by itself I had to remove and reinstall. I have an orbi router with a satellite and I'm not sure if the software with the bell is just not friendly with it or what but I finally removed it and returned it which as always with amazon went smoothly.

Then I realized the surface I screwed it to was uneven and may be putting pressure on the device in a way that would cause it to loosen. I moved it an inch onto a flatter surface and now it works perfectly. The tension is perfect to hold it securely, allow you to use the volume ring, install and uninstall your echo, without worrying that it will fall out.

The screw privided was too long for my application (underneath a quartz counter), so I had to provide my own shorter screw, but that wasn't hard.","07 17, 2016",A1PMCKAH4UMFWJ,"Took a few tries to install, and now we're loving it.",1468713600,FALSE

The Netflix app is my most used app. The sound skews further and further from the video on my Samsung smart TV's netflix app, but its PERFECT through the firestick!
Having just one more additional remote is kind of annoying... but I know they want you to keep alexa in your hands so you're more likely to use her, AND the remote is wifi or bluetooth... doesn't need line of sight... which is good (required?) since the firestick is on the back of most peoples TVs.
Its just slightly annoying having pop ups on a TV occasionally (not sure if thats the app, the stick, or what). I don't have prime, maybe that would help?
Only other annoying part is that each app is its own program/layout, so they all have different menus and layouts. You have to know if the show you want to watch is on NBC, ABC, CBS, Science, HG TV, etc etc etc... then once you enter their app, you are left with their setup. Maybe nothing is free (requiring cable service login), maybe everything is free, maybe there's a recently watched section, maybe not. Maybe the free stuff is listed all in one neat menu, or spread around. Some apps tell you things are locked right away, others wait till you find something you want to watch and hit play, then tell you that you don't have that access. Every company/app has their stuff laid out differently. I guess you'd get accustomed to your favorite ones over time.

I've never had a roomba or other type of robot vacuum and I'm a first time mom with a 7 week old. I was actually considering upgrading my Shark stick vac for a cordless Dyson stick vac until I saw this deal. Honestly I don't know if the scheduling option on the next model up is necessary when i can just push the button whenever i need. I have noticed that other models are sold with additional parts like walls for not much more, but I feel like if I wanted an upgrade I would just save up for one with wifi in the future.

I usually vacuum my house once every 1 or 2 weeks and have to empty out the dust bin multiple times. I have an all hard wood 3 bedroom 2 bath single story house with lots of thin area rugs and one large shag rug in the nursery. The roomba will not tackle the shag and I didn't expect it to, but it exceeds my expectations on the rest of the house. It is so much easier to press a button for light vacuuming several times a week (I've been doing it daily since i got it just because its such a novelty). At first the dust bin would fill up pretty fast from areas that I cant reach with my handheld, but now it runs for over an hour and hits all my rooms on one cycle and my home is spotless.

Pros:
1. I love the dual extruders. This is a must have. I tried printing ABS with the left head and PLA with the right. The PLA head is great for printing the raft. It separates from the ABS and build platform super easily. It's also great for printing dual colors or having a dedicated support material (they even make a water soluble one).
2. The build volume is generous, which is one reason I picked this one.
3. Heated bed/enclosed ABS performance is great. I opened the window during an ABS print and you could tell for about 15 layers it was warped during that time period. The enclosed space works.

Cons:
1. I am using Fusion 360. I was a little disappointed that it appears the autodesk Meshmixer formats are not supported. I ended up paying an additional $150 for Simplify3d instead. It works great.
2. No wifi, but normally it's more reliable to print from SD Card anyway. It takes a long time to complete an intricate 3d print, so why risk a Windows update interrupting the job?
3. No filament runout detection
4. No auto leveling bed
5. No camera for remote monitoring - you can supply your own of course. But there is no where to mount one either.
6. Would be wonderful if it had a light under the print head, but it does not.
7. No emergency stop button

Other thoughts:
1. I ordered an Amazon alexa power outlet and I already have a camera system. Prints can take 5 hours or more, so I won't always be around. If it begins to misprint while you are out, you will want to shut it off remotely. This goes for any 3d printer.
2. Print quality - I did not mention because it will depend on slicer settings and filament. Subjectively, it prints ""pretty good"" but I have no basis of comparison.

it is plastic, why I mention it is, because those metal go up and down in price. plastic does not. I am not complaining that this is made of plastic I am complaining that they charge almost $400 as if it was made from expensive materials.
This is catered to people who have excess income, nothing wrong with that, ?There is a reason why ford is a much bigger company that ferrari, it is because they sell cars that most people can buy and sell more.
If this was made like a Ferrari I would not complain about the price, but it is not made with high end material like a Ferrari it is made of plastic like a ford. we are being charged for a Ferrari and getting a ford.

Simply put if you charge less for it you sell allot more and make a bigger profit over all.

(Forgive me Amazon, this is out of stock at present - though I found Verzazio through searching here, hence the review here.) I ordered them on Thanksgiving and got them by Monday (!!!) and the gems were carefully packaged - opening it was like playing with nesting dolls in the best way. My scale clocked it at 20.4 grams, approx 102 carats. I received only two 10x8mm-ish green onyx and a smaller carnelian, which are far more plentiful in other wholesale gem lots in my experience. Five of the smoky quartz stones had chips, and one small amethyst and one garnet also lost a bit at a facet. The most numerous stones were garnet - in particular, marquis cut red-violet rhodolite, but also several red to redblack almandine and a few thinly cut 3-5mm that were more orangey. They were also the most uniform in size, no smaller than 3mm and the largest being a dark 7x5x4mm almandine, and representative of all the types of cuts except trillion. The smallest gems I got were peridot, and almost all had inclusions (including a single dot that was literally, I measured, perfectly faceted around on a 3mm gem); the largest peridot was a 6x3mm-ish marquis cut, the rest mostly pear cuts and 1.5-2.5mm rounds. The amethyst had less ""between"" sizes than the other gem types - several generous oval cuts of varying hue, an evenly cut and deeply colored 4mm trillion, and then inclusion free 3mm, 2mm, and one 1.5mm rounds.
The second largest amethyst I received has five ghostly, parallel, evenly spaced terminated rutilations (aka stripes) when viewed from an angle - I thought it was a trick on my eyes from the spiral of my notebook when I noticed it. From the other angle the inclusion scatters naturally into the darkness of the gem. Awesome.
There was an even quantity of blue topaz to yellow topaz, blues larger on average, and I even got one 10x9x5mm (largest gem of the bag) and two small prasiolite (green to clear amethyst). I also received one stone that resembles citrine, but I am uncertain for sure since it's all alone (it sticks out badly against the yellow topaz I bagged it with). I also also received a 4mm pear-cut gem that may be alexandrite, as I thought it was another yellow topaz until I brought it out in different light and it appeared olive.

This band, now being one of the most prominent groups in the metalcore genre alongside bands such as Bring Me The Horizon and Of Mice & Men, has started off with a rather strong debut album!

Stand Up and Scream is a powerful onslaught of a mix of metalcore and electronicore. Heavy guitars, occasional nuances of electronics and synthesizer work, and well done vocals from singer Danny Worsnop. His range going from amazing clean singing, to high pitch screams and low guttural growls.

The most notable songs for me are ""The Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)"", ""Everyday's the Weekend"", ""I Used to Have A Best Friend (But then He Gave Me an STD)"", ""Hey There, Mr. Brooks"", ""I Was Once Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps, A Cowboy King"", ""A Prophecy"", and ""Not the American Average"".

Although the song titles can be a bit long, and for a few of them maybe a little awkward, they are still great songs.

One thing's for sure, Metalcore, like Nu Metal, is often looked down upon by Metalheads who are more familiar with older and more traditional forms of heavy metal. Mostly because it's ""not metal"" to them for not having that feel that older metal bands have. Or that it's ""unoriginal"" or ""watered-down"" for them. And of course, there's always the elitists in metal who will relentlessly and immaturely heckle anything other than their favorite band(s).

Don't listen to those guys, and don't let anyone bring you down saying your taste is music is ""crap"". Listen to whatever you want, and whatever makes you happy and feel good. Ive opened my mind up to bands like asking alexandria two years ago, and now I'm in love with them. I personally think it's silly (even downright comical) to say metalcore is not metal.

It being a fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk, it sounds like both to me. The way I see it, fusion genres are genres of both or all their fusing elements. Same thing applies to Nu Metal, Deathcore, etc.

Anyway...

So much has went into this album from what has become an incredible band. Releasing two more great albums, ""Reckless and Relentless"" in 2011, and ""From Death to Destiny"" in 2013, this band has come quite a way and progressed in their music, perfecting everything that needed some tweaking.

caught somewhere in time: i like this song alot when i listen to this song i feel like im transported to a dark and mysterious future i would love to see iron maiden play this this song live but thats probably not gonna happen 10/10 (11/10 if i could see them play it live)

wasted years: this song has one very catchy intro and a amazing solo it was also entirely written by adrian smith most of maidens songs are written by steve harris 10/10

sea of madness: this is another song written by adrian and i love how steves bass just punches you in the face in this one its one of my personal favorites from the album 10/10

heaven can wait: this is probably the weakest track one the cd for me but i thought it was pretty cool how they got all the managers producers and whoever eles to do that oo o oooo thing in the middle of the song that was a really good idea they should have done that for when they wer recording fear of the dark(the song) 7/10

the loneliness of a long distance runner: not much to say on this one other than its gotta catchy intro 7/10

stranger in a strange land: there is only one word that can describe this song and that word is awesome
awesome/10

de ja vu: i really like the guitar in this one altho the lyrics are pretty silly but who cares the guitar is awesome 9/10

alexander the great: the song it self is basically a history lesson about alexander the great witch i wished they played in history class in my freshman year of high school instead of writing down all those pointless notes and watching that terribly boring video about him despite all that its a EPIC!!! song even with the fact it reminds me of greek history witch i hated freshman year 9/10

This disc doesn't have one lesser track on it.  It was the maiden disc that I have enjoyed the most from them.  Songs like 'alexander the great'

I instantly liked the first recording and have to say i prefer Di'Anno's vocals over Dickenson's, but musically i really think ""somewhere in time"" is the best maiden i've heard.  In all fairness though, i think Dickenson did a fantastic job on this disc that might have one-upped anything Di'Anno might have done.  For instance, ""wasted years"" couldn't be done by anybody but dickenson, a killer track.  Dickenson's vocals on ""sea of madness"" also impressed me.

Many fans didn't like the addition of the synthesizers into maiden's recordings, but i really think it made maiden harder and have a much fuller sound than their previous outputs.  The opening of the song ""somewhere in time"" is one of my favorite song openers of all time.  This song captures the creativity and spirit of iron maiden, which is kind of like a sci-fi theme, an interesting use of the metal genre.

Alot of the percussion has more double bass than what you're used to hearing from nicko (not a bad thing at all) and the bass is just as melodic and pounding as before, and they are all just kicking ass througout... but the production seems a little more distant and sometimes the guitars get buried under it which means that alot of the melodies are not as clean and clear as they should be but the risky move pays off because the synths add alot to the songs... even though they defenitely comes off a little too strongly once in a while.

There are a few songs on this album that are catchy (heaven can wait, stranger in a strange land, wasted years) but don't really have the substance of the others...The songs caught somewhere in time, and the lonilness of the long distance runner have some of Iron maidens most elegant melodies... and they're also heavier than most of what theyve done up to this point in the classic era. Sea of madness also has a really awesome chorus... and alexander the great is pretty good, even though there is sort of a noodling section in it that doesnt mesh well with the song.

I think the good songs on this album, are defenitely worth the price (actually the best songs on somewhere in time would give anything on piece of mind or powerslave a run for their money) but there are also alot of other sections where it gets repetetive, and the songs all tend to blur into each other... there is a pretty well defined prog thing going on here too, and a few of the songs lose momentum because there are some relentlessly mean solos that unfortunately drag on a bit, but the guys always pull the songs back into perspective just before you're ready to get frustrated or bored.

If you were to just buy this album,having never heard any other Iron maiden albums, it would stand pretty high on its own, but Id probably get any one of the other three ""classic dickinson"" maiden albums first... even though some of my favorite iron maiden songs are on this album.","03 23, 2005",A2F7HLFS00FA1J,a little inconsistent,1111536000,FALSE

while looking through the list songs in mp3 form found a song called day of my life - pop version(from Killing rasputin)
i thought to myself a musical based on the mad monk,what a strange title for a show & i gotta to check this out!
i'm a fan of musicals some successful,unsuccessful,ignored,forgotten or underappreciated but this is most obscure musicals in existence!
All i know about this show it started out in 1994 a show Yusupov was staged at Andrew llody Webber's house at sydmonton
(only two videos exist from that show on youtube channel called meredithbraunonline.)
about 4 years later the show was retitled killing rasputin & performed in london at Bridewell theatre,ran for two years.
after that it disappeared there has been no revival,script to the show & only a synopsis in the cd booklet by the track number of songs!
i've seen only found review one at jeromepradon.com & an editorial about the creators of show at what's on stage.

The story

Gospodi - In st.petersbrug,1915 the romanvo rule of the Russian empire is at the of it's glory!
while a chorus is singing as the show opens. sung by Ensemble.

World hold your breath - outside the army,led by Dmitri romanov(the nephew of the tsar)suppress an uprising in a small town.
sung by Ensemble.

Here it is/you'll never never know - later Dmitri is hosting a ball at the winter place during which he claims his love for his cousin princess Irina. Irina's protestations are interrupted by the arrival of a holy man begging for money.
Dmitri threatens to kill him if he doesn't leave. the man laughs,prophesying that if he is killed by a Romanov the royal family will be slaugthered & russia will bleed for a lifetime. he leaves and a shaken dimtri announces he and Irina are to be married. she's horrified as he sweaps her off to celebrate at the aquarium cabaret.
There the m.c. introduces the evening's entertainment a singer of posie & beauty. the singer intrances him.
only later after their first kiss the singer reavels herself to be prince yusupov,the richest man in Russia who is much despised by the Romanovs for his hedonistic life-style. Dmitri is inrepelled & intrigued.
sung by Leigh mcdonald,hal fowler & ensemble.

Kyrie - some days later,the holy man arrives at yusupov's place. he is Grigor rasputin.
yusupov is overwhelmed by his charisma,especially when he proves his extraordinary power by healing the tsarina's haemophiliac son alexei. sung by Jerome pardon.

Yusupov's soliloquy - he reflects his own need for help. sung by Hal fowler.

To love is to hate - Rasputin observes that they are fover bound in the eternal cycle of good and evil.
sung by Jerome pardon.

Act 1 finale - When yusupov is at his most vulnerable rasputin leaves him,he's taken all he wanted from the prince.
yusupov now understands what it means to betrayed. the act ends with him declaring his love to an astonished irina as rasputin manipulates the tsarina & begins his accent to power!
sung by Meredith braun,Jerome pradon(as Rasputin speaking with Alexandra then sings out in the streets),Gay soper(spoken scene only as alexandra,Hal fowler(speaking while the citzens of st.petersburg singing a reprise of world hold your breath)& Ensemble.

If only it would stop - Act two opens in Germany,1916 Dmitri is in the trenches of WW1,
after reading irina's letter he longs to be killed.
sung by Andrew Halliday & Meredith braun(spoken part during int break).

So nearly perfect - Back in st.petersbrug yusupov has converted part of his place into a hospital for the war-wounded.
Irina is helping him tend the injured,as they work together realizing how much they need each other.
dmitri's carried into the hospital,badly wounded.
Yusupov leaves to the tsarina to put a stop to the slaughter.
my favorite song in the show. although very different from the first version,it's beautiful! but i understand the need to change it. just i wish they kept the whole love duet instead of the brief shorted version on cd.
sung by Meredith braun & Hal fowler.

Nothing is the same - With yusupov so changed,and dmitri back in Russia,irina reflects on wants she wants.
sung by Meredith braun.

He heals the pain - Yusupov begs the tsarina to see what Rasputin is doing to their country,but she is binlded by gratitude for he has done for her son. sung by Gay soper.

Tennis and picnics - Next he tells dimtri that to save Russia they must kill rasputin. but he only wants to retreat into the memory of what his world once was. sung by Andrew Halliday.

Liebling - While the M.c inonically muses on the closeness of the tsarina's relationship with rasputin.
sung by Leigh McDonald.

Come to the street - The people of st.petersburg are losing patience with the system that has oppressedthem for so long.
sung by ensemble & Gay soper(as Alexandra singing in a church or looking out the window of the place. based on my listening to the last part!)

The invitation/Day of my life - Aware that time is running out,yusupov invites the monk to his place using the one bait he knows Rasputin can't resist...Irina. yusupov prepairs himself for what he believes to be his finest moral act the killing of Rasputin. ending the show. sung by Jerome pradon & Hal fowler.

Re Code Veronica takes place after RE 2, Claire Redfield inhabits a umbrella corp. lab in europe and gets captured. There she is taken to a european prison on the island somewhere. She there meets Steve Burnside who is another prisoner of the island. You find out his family was killed by Umrella and he wants revenge. Claire tells steve she is there to find her lost brother Chris Refield. through out the game you also meet alexander and alexia ashoford, grandchildren of umbrella's founders. you also discover Wesker is back and wants alexia body so he can get the virus sample from her.

You can later on play as Chris which is good yet it gets harder when you do as the enemies get stronger and different. You battle different bosses, do puzzle, and other cool stuff. but i must WARN you that there are a number of things that will frustate you and make you mad.

FRUSTRATING THINGS: 1. the enemies take forever to kill and take many rounds to exterminate plus being in small numbers they are hard and will piss you the hell off.

2. The puzzles will get to you and there are some puzzles where if you do not do them right, you will die and game over, this also will piss you the hell off.

3. Lastly, the bosses take a while to beat, being some hints of how to beat them lying around, you will have to figure the best strategy for their defeat. this also will piss you off entirely.

Excluding wanting to break the controller and throw your PS2 out the window, it is a great game with a good plot, cool weapons, cool environments, and very cool cutscenes. NOTE: THE PS2 VERSION HAS SOME EXTRA CUTSCENES THAT SPICES UP THE GAME.

after beating it and having the good feeling of defeating the challenge, you go though a deal of cool cutscenes and unlock a few good things. You can unlock a special 'battle game' where you can choose a character from the main game and go on a small adventure with unlimited ammo through random rooms and destroy the creatures.

The game also gives you a special demo disc of 'devil may cry' as well which is quite neat to play...

Overall, i give it four stars for being such a indepth game and a joyous one at that.

--------------------------------------------

Original review.

I was disappointed with this product, and should have read the 1/2* reviews before buying.  The regular review sites seem to have skimmed over a lot of the downsides with the product. I'll cover them here.

I was excited about the hardware potential and google really pushing the new android tv platform.  My expectations were that this would be able to replace my chromecast, roku3 and a windows PC I keep hooked up to the tv to stream what the prior two won't, which lately isn't much.

First off, the much vaunted voice search sucks.  It couldn't tell what I was saying part of the time.  I have two other google devices that fare better than this, and an alexa amazon device that gets it right 98% of the time.  Worse, when I said something like ""play Sons of Anarchy"", which I'm currently watching on netflix, it brought up the show with an offer to buy it from two premium services and skipped right over the fact that it was available to me for free on netflix.

Next is the lack of common android apps.  No browser, no email, no facebook, etc.  While I can (and did) sideload those, they aren't automatically updated and I couldn't even find a way for them to show up on the main screen.  While there probably is a way, I'd really like to run the same apps I can run on my wimpy 2 year old tablet on a premier flagship android device.

So I figured I'd at least try out some of the hundreds of games I own.  Pretty much nothing is compatible.  I went into dozens and dozens of apps and games and every one said 'incompatible'.  I even loaded the amazon app store and similarly, many apps don't show as compatible.  Of course, I can play older style console games bought from nvidia, and there is a streaming service that lets me play other apps.  But you have to pay for that and its not cheap.

Stream wise, this supports netflix and hulu.  No amazon video.  While the 2.0 release was supposed to bring HBO support, after upgrading the unit to 2.0 I saw nothing HBO related.  No NFL sunday ticket app, no NFL app, no WatchESPN.

My final take on this is if all you want to stream is Netflix and Hulu, you want to buy NVIDIA's game and streaming services, and you want 4k/60fps video from netflix, this is a nice box.  If you want to stream a reasonable full array of current streaming services (like a roku player can), you want to run routine android apps (like every phone/tablet can) or you want to game with play store or amazon app store games you already own, its hit and miss...mostly miss.","10 5, 2015",A2UCZAWAN5QMJQ,Disappointed,1444003200,TRUE

Last years game was not awful as some say,but it couldve been better. I like how they are making games more real based. The stamina meter is great,and getting on top rope uses energy and it takes time. Some people should give the creators a break, its hard to please everyone. Instead of everyone whining, why don't they try making a game, see how much better you do.

This years game,  i give 4 stars.  Here's why it doesnt get 5.
Yes stone cold steve austin was the man back in the late 90s ,early 2000s, but that was then,he isn't now and hasn't even wrestled in 12  almost 13 years. He had absolutely no business, being the cover superstar. To make the showcase mode, solely about him was just uncalled for. Wwe 2k14 ,focused on the attitude era,that was great they did, but again 2 years later??? Really?  That got to me.  Wwe games should move on from including so many legends.  Those legends were good during their time, but let them be legends.  Seth Rollins should've been the cover star, or Brock lesnar.  Those 2 are bringing the wwe good money.  I feel Wwe should be more with the present and less about the past.  Have all the main roster, and all of the nxt roster,  then if you have enough space to include legends,then do so. If anything else ,make the legends downloadable content.  General adnan, and rick rude,and srgnt slaughter?? Why?  Sorry,but who would want to play as them at this era. I can understand andre, and hulk hogan and macho man, but not those others .  My career has improved ,as did the moves set.  Wwe universe is slowing getting better, i love how you can attack during entrances, even tho the commentary is lame, they still did ok.  I try to see the good in everything,  no game will be perfect.  The divas Sasha banks,  bayley and beck lynch and charlotte ,alexa bliss, dana brooke  should've been added, no excuse in that. If they weren't so busy trying to put soooo many legends in there, they couldve done it. Im not a crybaby tho, im sure next years will be even better as wwe games tend to get better each year.  the reversal idea was fantastic, but not the submission system. If you aren't careful u can be submitted even at the start of the match.  The pin system is ok, but when u get hit with a finisher at the end, you have to hold x then release in the zone,  while earlier in the match,  you just tap x in the zone, very confusing and uncalled for.  I like this game overall and recommend it.

After 6 months of trying to make my blender/food processor (cuisinart) worth the time and effort to assemble, use and then clean up I followed a recommendation from someone on Weight Watchers and bought a magic bullet from WalMart online.

I've had it a week.

I use it several times a day.

So far we've whipped up phenomenal hummus, excellent pesto, pancakes, smoothies, chicken salad, chocolate mousse - which i made with heavy whipping cream, extra dark cocoa powder and some splenda, and milk shakes.  Salsa, alfredo, and soup are on our list.

But my favorite use is for our evening drink. After a long day at work it's wonderful to toss in the ingredients and mix up a martini (recipe in book) or brandy alexander (1.5 oz brandy, 1 oz cream de cacao, 1 oz half & half, 1 ice cube) and serve in a martini glass.  A minute later and we're sitting on our balcony enjoying the city lights.  No ""shaker"" to clean, no wasting ice, nothing.  Just blend and serve.

My blender and food processor are now put away and I may even go back to grinding my own coffee beans.  Most importantly, I'm not wasting valuable time in cleanup.  Rinse and dry is my new motto.","10 22, 2005",A1J97V1KB3RU40,Perfect for a Woman on the Go,1129939200,FALSE

Upon opening the box, everything was packaged nicely, the setup was very easy to connect to wifi as well. The vacuum robot worked very good at the start. It is now 3 months of owning this robot. It has some quirks to it. On occasion the robot will stop cleaning when its parked on an object and send a message on the app saying its stuck, ""clear my path"". There was no obstructions from the stupid thing backing up or turning. Super weird. One day I recieved a message saying it cannot see, an air duster fixed that problem. Other occasions it would say clean its full, and there is no debris in the cannister.  It seems to get stuck pretty easy. Make sure you pick up everything around the floor. Its rollers will get stuck on chords, socks, or anything item that can be sucked up larger than a nickel will get lodged and you will get a notification. Helpful, but annoying. It does a good job when the floors are pre prepped for the robot for the most part. There are areas in the corners where it does have difficulty reaching, but I do like the systematic cleaning vs. the random pattern mode other vaccuums do. I love that it can be activated from alexa, and the app is pretty easy to work. Ive spoken to many owners of diffrent vacuum robots, these are all common issues with all of them.

I use the neato twice a day and it is so nice not to vacuum myself.
The only thing the neato app and alexa app need is a return to base feature. That would make it so much nicer.

All-white minimalist design and this window air conditioner cools very efficiently. iOS app works well when it works. Like most first generation appliance apps, Frigidaire needs to work on improving the ability for the unit to maintain a wifi connection. It does currently have alexa support but HomeKit is still pending, apparently.
Resetting is easiest by unplugging the unit and re-plugging in to boot up the wifi connection to the app again. I own two units and the app can support multiple smart Frigidaire units. I can monitor the temperature of each room together on the app's home screen then open controls individual unit operation.  The scheduling feature of the app works flawlessly for me as I've set my bedroom unit once and it works great.

There are no buttons just touch-sensitive controls on top. The minimalist remote control is also not sight-impaired friendly but works. One must press the power button once to ""wake-up"" the LED illuminations and temperature read-out. It is a perfect bedroom unit overall because there are no illuminations on continuously and the fan is relatively quiet. The compressor makes normal noises based on the weather conditions and overall cycling use.  Operating the unit on low fan only mode is whisper quiet. The air output grill is upward but is adjustable and airflow can be pointed outward facing or left/right.

Overall, my multiple units were solid purchases and replaced older Frigidaire models that worked flawlessly for 12 years and were donated as they still work.  I am very happy with my purchase via Amazon and were delivered by UPS with minimal box/unit damage considering the weight. Both of my units were slightly dented on the exteriors.","05 13, 2018",A25W3ZAIS642DK,"A beautiful, ""Smart-enough"", very-efficient and reasonably quiet air conditioner.",1526169600,TRUE

one vibrates when the fan runs on any speed but worse at high speed which is caused by improper balancing in the manufacturing process. vibration is similar to having bass high on sterio system and you can feel the entire wall shaking. Both units have continuous issues with the wifi app and alex control. So in other words never mind using alexa she only got them to work on the first day of install now she says there is an issue connecting every time. i paid a very decent price for these and now im on the fence if i should return them.","05 12, 2018",A2QWONBCWDV187,Updated they shipped me two replacement units.,1526083200,TRUE
